\subsection{MLE for Polynomial Basis Function Regression}
We implemented a maximum likelihood estimator for a linear regression with polynomial basis functions, using the formula $\V w = (\M X'\M X)^{-1} \M X'\M Y$. Note that in \texttt{MATLAB} we instead of using the inverse function. The replicated plots are as follows:
